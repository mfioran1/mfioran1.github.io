My name is Maurice Fiorani, I am 33 years old and am looking to start a new chapter in my life. I've been a bartender for a little over 10 years now, and while the job has been great to me considering I got to travel around the world because of my flexible scheduling, it feels like it is time for a change. Now that I am getting a bit older, it's harder for me to stay up working late nights, and to be frank dealing with drunk people all night is getting a little tiresome.
So I started thinking about what I wanted to do as a career after this. I've always enjoyed building and tinkering with computers ever since my dad showed me how as a kid, so I started looking somewhere in the tech field to see what piqued my interest. Coding looked like a job that I would enjoy doing, because it is kind of to me almost like solving a puzzle. Funny enough my brother started to get into coding around the same time I was and we started talking about it. Lo and behold now I'm back in school learning this now and enjoying my time doing (which is a first for me school-wise). These first two weeks have been a lot of information to retain but I am excited for what is going to come and have been enjoying my time so far!
